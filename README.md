# About
The Bay Area High School eSports League (BAHSEL) is made up of a coalition of Bay Area high schoolers seeking to cultivate a competitive eSports environment for local high school students. 

We host tournaments featuring all major eSport games, including League of Legends, VALORANT, Overwatch, CS:GO, and Minecraft.

For the past 2 years, we have offered the competitive eSports experience to over 600 students from over 30 different high schools, starting in October 2020. Since then, we have hosted 7 phases of events, with over 20 separate tournaments, and created and hosted a Minecraft server featuring Bedwars, UHC, Skywars, and a SMP world. We have streamed nearly all competitive elimination matches on our Twitch channel for hundreds of unique viewers, hosted viewer games in both ARAM and tetr.io, and even coordinated a Twitch Rivals-style draft for a League of Legends and VALORANT tournament. In the past, we have also collaborated a local eSports club from Milpitas High School to run tournaments. 

We hope to expand to host tournaments in more and more games in the future, including osu! and Tetris (tetr.io). Tournaments are traditionally hosted over Spring Break, Summer, Thanksgiving Break, and Winter Break, and generally either happen in the span of 1-2 weeks with games played each day or across multiple weeks, with games played on the weekend.
