      <p>
        The Bay Area High School eSports League (BAHSEL) is made up of a coalition
        of Bay Area high schoolers seeking to cultivate a competitive eSports
        environment for local high school students.
      </p>

      

      <p>
        We host tournaments featuring all major eSport games, including League of
        Legends, VALORANT, Overwatch, CS:GO, and Minecraft.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the past 2 years, we have offered the competitive eSports experience
        to over 600 students from over 30 different high schools, starting in
        October 2020. Since then, we have hosted 7 phases of events, with over 20
        separate tournaments, and created and hosted a Minecraft server featuring
        Bedwars, UHC, Skywars, and a SMP world. We have streamed nearly all
        competitive elimination matches on our Twitch channel for hundreds of
        unique viewers, hosted viewer games in both ARAM and Tetris, and even
        coordinated a Twitch Rivals-style draft for a League of Legends and
        VALORANT tournament. In the past, we have also collaborated a local
        eSports club from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/milpitashighesports/?hl=en">Milpitas High School</a> to run tournaments.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope to expand to host tournaments in more and more games in the
        future, including osu! and Tetris (<a href="https://tetr.io/">tetr.io</a>). Tournaments are traditionally
        hosted over Spring Break, Summer, Thanksgiving Break, and Winter Break,
        and generally either happen in the span of 1-2 weeks with games played
        each day or across multiple weeks, with games played on the weekend.
